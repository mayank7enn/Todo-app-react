# Todo-app-React

A simple To-Do list application built with React and Context API.

## Description

This is a simple To-Do list application built with React and Context API. The application uses local storage to persist the todo items between sessions.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Context API
- CSS Modules
- JavaScript
- HTML

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/user/10TodoContextLocal.git

Then install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install

Finally, start the development server:
    
    ```sh
    npm install

#### Usage
Once the server has started, you can open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

You can add new todo items by typing them into the input field and pressing enter. The items will appear in the list. You can also mark items as complete by clicking the checkbox next to them.

The todo items will be persisted to local storage, so they will still be there when you refresh the page or close the browser.
